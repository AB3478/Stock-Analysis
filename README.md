# Stock-Analysis

## Overview of Project

#### Steve is interested in using Visual Basic Applications (VBA) to automate the process of evaluating stock data. To facilitate Steve’s data analysis, we’ll refactor the code to ensure the VBA script is as fast and efficient as possible.

## Results

#### To determine how stocks performed between 2017 and 2018, we identified the total daily volume and the return (or the difference between the ending price and the starting price). Stocks had greater returns in 2017--all but one of the stocks had positive returns in 2017. It took a total of 2.08 seconds to run the 2017 results. The amajority of stocks in the 2018 ticker search were larlgely negative. Of the 12 stocks, only 2 had positive returns (ENPH, RUN)
